###0x02. C - Functions, nested loops###

In C programming, functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help organize and modularize code by allowing the programmer to define reusable units of functionality. Functions can take input parameters, perform operations, and return results. Nested loops, on the other hand, involve placing one loop inside another. This arrangement enables the repetition of a set of instructions within the outer loop, each time the inner loop completes its cycle. This combination of functions and nested loops provides a powerful mechanism to create complex and structured programs in C, enhancing code readability, reusability, and efficiency by breaking down tasks into manageable components and iterating over them in controlled patterns
