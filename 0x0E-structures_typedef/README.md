###💻️0x0E. C - Structures, typedef work💻️###

A structure is a user defined data type available
in C that allows to combine data items of
different kinds.
The C programming language provides a
keyword called typedef, which you can use to
give a type, a new name.
Besides functions you can also write documentation for structs, unions, enums and typedefs.
Instead of the function name you must write the name of the declaration;
the struct/union/enum/typedef must always precede the name. Nesting of declarations is not supported.
Use the argument mechanism to document members or constants.
