Welcome to ALX-Low_Level_Programming

C is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. Developed in the early 1970s, C provides a balance between high-level abstraction and low-level control, making it suitable for system-level programming, application development, and even embedded systems. Its syntax and features influenced many other programming languages, and it remains a foundational language in the field, valued for its direct interaction with hardware, memory management capabilities, and extensive library support.
