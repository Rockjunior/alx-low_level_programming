###0x15. C - File I/O###

File I/O, short for File Input/Output, is a fundamental concept in computer programming that enables programs to interact with external files stored on a computer's storage system. In the context of File I/O, "input" refers to reading data from files into a program, and "output" pertains to writing data from a program to files. This process allows applications to store and retrieve information persistently, making it accessible even after the program terminates. File I/O operations involve opening files, reading or writing data, and closing files once the operations are completed. Programmers utilize specific functions or methods provided by programming languages to perform these tasks, facilitating the seamless exchange of data between programs and external files. Proper understanding and implementation of File I/O are crucial for tasks such as data storage, configuration management, and data processing in various software applications.
