###0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings###

Pointers, arrays, and strings are fundamental concepts in the C programming language. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses, enabling dynamic memory allocation and manipulation. They allow for efficient referencing and indirect access to variables and data structures. Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. They provide a way to group related data and access elements using index notation. Strings in C are character arrays, terminated by a null character ('\0'). They represent sequences of characters and are used extensively for text processing. Pointers and arrays are closely related: an array's name can be used as a pointer to its first element, and pointer arithmetic can navigate through array elements. Strings, as character arrays, can be manipulated using pointers and various string functions provided by the C standard library, making them a vital component of C programming for tasks involving text and character manipulation.
