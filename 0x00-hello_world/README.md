###0x00. C - Hello, World###


An introduction to C programming delves into the fundamental concepts of computer programming using the C language. It covers the process of writing code, the subsequent compilation of the code using a compiler, and the role of the assembler in converting high-level code into machine-readable instructions. The "printf" function, a crucial part of C, is explored as a means to display output to the console, enabling interaction with users. Additionally, the role of the preprocessor is explained, highlighting its function in handling directives such as "#include" and macro expansions prior to the actual compilation, streamlining the development process and enhancing code modularity.
