###0x0F. C - Function pointers###

Variadic functions in C are a powerful feature that allows a function to accept a variable number of arguments. These functions are defined with an ellipsis (...) in their parameter list, enabling them to handle a flexible number of arguments passed by the caller. Variadic functions are commonly used in situations where the number of arguments cannot be predetermined, such as in printf() and scanf() functions, making them essential for creating versatile and adaptable code in C programming.
