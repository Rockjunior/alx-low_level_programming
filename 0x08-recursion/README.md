Recursion in C programming refers to the technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It offers an elegant approach to solving complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler instances of the same problem. During recursion, each recursive call reduces the original problem into a smaller subproblem until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion terminates. Careful handling of base cases and parameter manipulation is crucial to prevent infinite loops. Recursion is commonly used in scenarios where problems exhibit self-similarity, such as traversing tree structures, searching algorithms, and mathematical calculations, offering a powerful tool for solving intricate challenges in a concise and intuitive manner.
