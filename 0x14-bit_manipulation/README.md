'/tmp/dnd_file-1/bitwise.PNG'

#Requirements

#General


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
    You are allowed to use _putchar
    You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded

Bit manipulation in C is a powerful technique that involves the manipulation of individual bits within binary representations of data. In C, you can perform various bitwise operations such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>), among others, to efficiently manipulate individual bits within integers and other data types. This technique is often used for tasks like setting or clearing specific bits in a variable, checking the status of certain flags, and optimizing code for memory and performance.

One common application of bit manipulation in C is working with hardware registers and low-level device control, where precise control over individual bits is essential. Additionally, it is frequently used in tasks like implementing data compression algorithms, encoding and decoding data, and optimizing algorithms for tasks like searching, sorting, and graphics processing. Mastering bit manipulation in C can lead to more efficient and compact code, making it a valuable skill for developers working on embedded systems, system-level programming, and performance-critical applications.
